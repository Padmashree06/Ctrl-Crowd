It also generates the data in the form of graph and table for easy analysis to the administrators.

Unique features :

1.Cost effective - As most of the AI models occupy larger storage which require high end hardware to process which is     costly . Our model is light (379kB) and it could be run on ESP32 which is very cheap comparitively.

2.Light-Weight - All the existing models are heavy and costly whereas this model occupies kilobytes of space.

3.No latency - As it is edge processing
